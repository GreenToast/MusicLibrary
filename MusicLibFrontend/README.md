## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone MusciLibFrontend

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).


### Running the App during Development

You can start this webserver with `npm start` but you may choose to
install the tool globally:

npm install -g http-server


Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by
running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
